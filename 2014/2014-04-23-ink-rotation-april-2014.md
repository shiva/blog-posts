I haven't been very good with rotating the inks in the last year. Having accumulated more than my share of inks, it is time to have fewer pens inked and rotate colors.

I still couldn't resist inking 9 pens! There are 3 pens I'm excited about -- 2 parker 51 and a custom pen made out of 10000 year-old bogwood (a gift from <a href="http://tinaferan.com">Christina</a>).
