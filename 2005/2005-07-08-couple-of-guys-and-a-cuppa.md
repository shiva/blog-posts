What are the odds of meeting a violinst and a chartered accountant (two people, ofcourse ;) ) in the same city on the same day, at the same cafe? Well, I did just that. I'm sorry to say that I managed to forget the name of this very interesting violinst, who educated me at the finese of Bach's compositions and also taught me a coupla chords on the guitar (Aparently he plays that too!! )

Well, I also met this kewl dude (deprived of rock since he arrived in Chennai). He calls himself Nitin, and is studying to be a chartered accountant. (Yo Nitin.. there I kept my promise.. I blogged about you).

Finally, I managed to drag my butt outta office before 10 PM. Let's hope this keeps up!
