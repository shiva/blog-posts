Started reading "[Illusions][0]" by Richard Bach. Often, I feel, that a book comes in your life, when you are ready for it. It presents itself, in ways you never would have imagined. I have heard of this book for the last 10 years. There has been a sopy at my parent's place (where I stayed for the better part of the last 10 years) and it never occured to me, to pick that small book (of about 200 odd pages) and give it a read.

This weekend has been a little disturbing, and when I was there lounging in my hall, on a Sturday hot afternoon, something caught the corner of my eye. This small book was jutting out admist the pile of rubbish that I have come to collect. It was odd. It was as if it was beckoning me to pick it up.. Urging me towards itself, a weird, yet sensible and completely discernable gravity...

I finally gave in, snapping out of the half-slumber, I picked it up and as the pages unfolded, so did the solutions to my worries. It was as if, this book was written a good 3 decades ago, with the full knowledge that a soul such as myself would want it, would benefit from the contents (immensly). Long live the hope of fateful coincidences!
