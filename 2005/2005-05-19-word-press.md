Wordpress is a nice small CMS written entirely using php and mysql!  
It makes using blogger, MT and other such services entirely useless!! If you have a website and would like to manage your website effectively go for [this][0]!!

I'm planning to switch to it in the near future! I'm working on choosing a nice skin and customising it for my site!  
Do check back soon!

\*Update 13-Nov-2009\* You shouldn't be here if you are looking for me. Well, considering that you are reading this, I've messed up somehow. You can find my latest ramblings at [http://blog.shiv.me][1], or if you are the micro-blogging kind, head over to [http://twitter.com/shiva][2] or [http://facebook.com/shivanand][3].

You are so inclined, you can drop me an email at shvelmur \[at\] gmail

Ohhh.. I forget, when I last wrote this wordpress was a nice small CMS, today, I would suggest you move to [HiSlain][4]. Written and maintained by a cool kid from India, [Yuvi][5]
