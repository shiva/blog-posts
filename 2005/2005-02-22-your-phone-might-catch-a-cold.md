[FIR of a virus on a phone][0]! A very warm welcome to the world of computing! Soon we will need antiviral software running on our phones all the time and that would mean that your phones will get more processing power. If phones take the way PCs have, the day when we will have a phone with a huge Pentium or whatever processor and tons of RAM won't be too far away.

A little over-engineering I say. Today, I can't get a system, that can do a bare minimum of tasks, everything has everything else built-in. This, of course, is a double edged sword! Although it helps to bring the cost down, I will end up paying for things that I might never use! What is the use of a graphics card (on-board intel810) for a system that I shall primarily use for word-processing, email and some browsing!
