There was once a wondeful browser called "Opera". The lucid interface, the smal memory footprint - it was simply browsing heaven.

Then came the version loaded with ads, heavy, sluggish UI and a hug memory footprint in the name of new improved UI. The ads loaded version of opera turned out to nag-ware and I totally detested it and moved to other browsers (read Firefox). Get online and check websites out became "swimming" and not "surfing"

Finally, the good old days are back! get the latest version of Opera sans ads for free.

Enjoy! Welcome back to the internet -let's go surfing
