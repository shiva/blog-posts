I have been wanting to integrate photos that I take into my Wordpress blog for over 6 months now!  
I finally found the best suited solution for me. Well almost! Probably the second best thing

I can now do the following:

* Insert images from my flickr stream into my blog.
* Present a gallery of images based on my sets
* The visitor can now search images based on flickr tags

These three together constitute my much enjoyable weekends these days!
