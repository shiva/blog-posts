I have been wanting to integrate photos that I take into my Wordpress blog for over 6 months now!  
I finally found the best suited solution for me. Well almost! Probably the second best thing

I can now do the following:

* Insert images from my flickr stream into my blog.
* Present a gallery of images based on my sets
* The visitor can now search images based on flickr tags

Check out my fair lady getting irritated with me for click too many pictures of her!

These three together constitute my much enjoyable weekends these days!
