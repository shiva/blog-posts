SNMP being the bread and butter for me, I decided to dig up some tutorials and links regarding the same.  
For the uninitiated, SNMP is short for Simple Network Management Protocol, and is a protocol used to manage network devices such as routers, switches etc.

* [Simple Web][0] - Introduction to SNMP, and good set of tutorials
* [Simple Times][1] - technical articles and featured columns
* [Cisco - SNMP Overview][2]
* [Cisco - whitepaper][3]
* [SnmpLink][4] - Links to almost every possible SNMP resource
