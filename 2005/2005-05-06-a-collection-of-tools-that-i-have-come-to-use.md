Well I confess, I'm a tool fanatic . Before you get werid ideas let me tell you that what I mean is that I like to use small, efficient utilities, that help me get my work done quickly. I have been on a perpetual hunt for **THE** best utility for almost all tasks.

A lot of my colleagues and friends seem to share this fascination for "those quick little things". So here is a list of some that I use quite regularly.

* [w.bloggar ][0] - Blog tool for Blogger.com

* [Putty][1] - SSH, SFTP client

* [KeyNote][2] - Content Management software

* [CrapCleaner ][3]- cleans unwanted files created by windows

* [ExplorerXP ][4]- File management

* [FileZilla ][5] - Ftp client

* [Html-Kit][6] - HTML editor

* [JAlbum ][7] - Photo album creator

* [Picasa ][8]- Photo Organiser
