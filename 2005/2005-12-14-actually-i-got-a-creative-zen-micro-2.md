I wanted to get the pod nano initially, but I chose to get the Creative Zen Micro instead for reasons listed below:

Why the Nano is a piece of junk  
1\. Cracked screens -- heard quite a few reports of that and since I live in India and the Nano cost about 2 as much as it is in the US, I didn't want to risk it

2\. Flimsy -- the entire player bends with little pressure applied, a little more I'm sure I'd end up with two pieces! (Definitely not suited for 40deg C and extremely dusty conditions that I have to go through everyday to work and back)

3\. Battery replacement costs half as much as the player

4\. about 25% more cost than the zen micro which has about 20% more space
