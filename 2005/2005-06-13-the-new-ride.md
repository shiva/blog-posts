I'm planning to get a new car in the offing.

The brand new Maruti Swift ! yup! It is quite a kewl car, modelled quite a bit on the new "Beetle"  
Check it out [here][0]

I'm planning to get the VXi variant without ABS. It has got a kewl 87Bhp@6500 and 113 Nm@4500! Detailed specs [here][1]  
Currently, I'm working out the financials, let us see how it goes.
