I took the Swift for a test drive last weekend. Amazing feeling I must say! The gear changes are soo slick, spot on .. like a hot knife through table butter!  
The acceleration is smooth, and yet let's you know it is there if you want to leave in a hurry. Perfect seating position for me (I'm 6'5").

The vehicle took my heart away. It's now a Swift or nothing at all! I'm booking it next weekend. Let me get my bonus!! pllluueeessse God pluuueeesse!
