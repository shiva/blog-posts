What a lousy week it has been... I've had this fever all week long, and is still poking its head around me now and then..

I have been down for the last few days with a viral fever. I also made the mistake of calling my family and telling them that I am unwell. They got very worried and came to Chennai in a taxi to pick me up (my mom). (That was embarrasing ... but did feel well pampered).

I will be getting my new [Creative Zen micro][0] (mp3 player) next week. Guru tell's me it sounds awesome. I hope he has got the [Sennheiser HD 202 headphones][1] I had him asked to buy. I'm gonna have a ball of a time next week, when I can finally lay hands on some kewl gadgets that I've been wanting to buy!
