PHP is an incredibly easy to use scripting language and yesterday I had my first meeting with it.

Yeah, I know I support and fix some issues in wordpress, but that just requires programming knowledge, and not exactly great php exposure. But yesterday, I wrote a small tool to track some timesheet info, in php and the whole thing took about 1.5 hours to complete. Slick UI, storing and retreiving from DB et al!

Simply amazed by the depth and breadth of support for other resources like databases, network protocols etc by the default implementation of php! Truly a programmer's paradise has to have a webserver running with php support!
