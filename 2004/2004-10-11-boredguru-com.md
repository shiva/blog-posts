Well, are you really bored with life and have a net connection, but none of the sites do anything for you?!! Well, here is one nice site that caught my attention when I was googling (_= verb. searching aimlessly on google with anything that comes to your mind!_)

Neat interface and no "signup with us if you want to use" thingy, gives good trivia and lots of news about the Indian job scene (if you would care to look at it!)
