Back from Delhi, after a much needed vacation. Set to really go full-throttle in the coming days at work! Now it's been almost a fornight since I uttered that word.

The day started early today at 4:20 AM! Pinky, actually, managed to wake me up at that hour! Kudos to you my sweet-heart. I miss you very much (yeah, yeah! I can almost hear you gasp "Already?!"). The journey was eventless though. No nasty surprises, except that my back arrived without the tags that they put during security check, and nothing seems to be missing.

What a great fornight! Went on a lovely trip in the hills of Himachal Pradesh - Delhi-Karnal-Barog-Chail-TimberTrail resorts(in the middle of nowhere)-Chandigarh-Delhi. Loads and loads of stuff happened throughtout the three day trip.

There is so much in our country to see and experince. I seriously regret, not having had the means to explore this country of mine. Have made myself a promise, that atleast once a year, I'll make a trip across this land of ours. Quite approriate on Independence Day uh?!
