[The Da Vinci Code - FAQs - Official Website of Dan Brown][0]

This book , "_The Da Vince Code_" (DVC), by **Dan Brown **is a must read by every person who has ever read a fiction novel. The most gripping tale that I've heard/read in quite some time.

The audacity of the author to lay questions about the foundations of the one of the most populous religions in this world has to be applauded. Further, he raises questions that make you question yourself!. Now ever, heard of a fiction autor make you do that.

A paperback that makes you think! Now that's a new one.

Btw, if you like the DVC, you might also want to take a peek at "_The unauthorised guide to the DVC_" by **Dan Burstein**
