[\[ lomographic society int. presents : LC-A : the lomo-compact-automat \]][0]

Lomography - a new meaning to "shooting from the hip"! Something that I would love to try one of these days... and I'm offering an opportunity to my readers !! if there are any? Shoot any image, conditions

1\. do not look through the viewfinder  
  
2\. shoot from hip-level  
  
3\. give a intro note to your image  
  
4\. send it to me (mail - jpg, cd/floppy - bmp)

mail me for my address : shvelmur@gmail.com

I will host the best of the lot at my site!

and write a blog about how great a lomographer you are!!
