Created a common blog site for my wife and me to blog on..  
  
This blogging thingy is amazing.... it really let's people open up and be much more communicative and open minded with the rest of the world.

let us see how she piks up blogging.. I think it should create some interesting dialogues between the two of us...

and yeah... you should get your wife and/or girlfriend (;) .. don't let one know abt the other) to blog with you ... is an interesting way of getting together on some activity and is not bound by time and location...

remember when your dad left notes for your mom on the refridgerator ...I think it is the modern fridge note!!! ;)
