[Google Desktop Search Download][0]

Check it out!!! I love thee Google, "Lord of Search"!!  
  
Really really neat way to access information. Very quick, a little scary considering that Google can go on to become the next MS! We the users of technology (particularly developers, testers etc) are going to have more exiciting times!!

Google Desktop is a like have the Google search engine installed for searching your system. it indexes your system, and ofcourse it currently supports only Microsoft products, but hope that a few of the open source software liek thunderbird and firefox are also supported soon.

Looking for that file that you know is about something , but just can't remember where you put it on your system.. no probs, just load up a browser with GDesktop and it'll find it for you!
