and yeah!!! the day has come, when I get to get my hands dirty with some VC++ coding!!

That has been the primary reason for me not blogging for such a long long time. Anyway, after about 15 - 20 days of a good dip in VC++, life is good.

Last week, Priyanka and me, we celebrated our marriage's first anniversary! I drove down to Pondicherry that night (8-sep-2004), on Shankar's bike! The bike is really trashed I say... At the end of the drive my hands were swollen and red. Gosh, I've never felt so much vibration on a bike.

On the way, I got to meet a coupla guys, who were fascinated with my helmet!

Had a great time the last coupla weeks. Hoping the good run continues!
