I have the very distinct feeling that a bunch of people from India, are going to visit my site today. Maybe, it is too late, but nonetheless, I was compelled to post before I left for work, after staying up the whole night (watching movies). No really - [Van Helsing][0] followed by [American Gangster][1] - two very find movies, I might add, but I digress.

I got the honour, of being one of the few listed on a fellow [tech-enthusiast][2]'s list of ["twittering" Indians.][3] It's not everyday that I make someone's list, and hence the compulsion to blog about it. So, thank you Yuvi. Since he described me as a programmer, on his list, it's only fair --

`  
if (knowsYuvi(you)) {  
Thanks for visiting this [blog][4];  
Between [work][5] and [twitter][6], I hardly update this space anymore;  
Do, [add it to your feedreader][7], so someday, you might see [something][8] [useful][9] :)  
} else {  
visit Yuvi's [blog][2];  
follow him on [twitter][10];  
send him a tweet, saying hi;  
}
