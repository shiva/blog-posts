* tumblr\> RottenBrains Â» Use all your speakers under OS X 10.4 [http://tinyurl.com/4kn6pz][7] [\#][8]
* @hyphn I should probably! That wouldn't form a loop though and pownce! :) [\#][9]
* @ashishpuri hey!! welcome back to the twitterverse .. how have you been [\#][10]
* @snookca Hey, does snitter support keyboard shortcuts?! [\#][11]
* @Shripriya it shows them threaded and latest thread first .. so in a way it is chronological [\#][12]
* @doshdosh using a wordpress.com blog is so much more painless, but then you can add new plugins etc. [\#][13]
* @nateritter and this would be where?! [\#][14]
* @nateritter hmmm... touch luck for all those potential startup employees! :) I suspect it would be a little higher in my hometown [\#][15]

* @nateritter Pondicherry, India [\#][17]
* @nateritter Are you using some tool/website that gives you this info?! [\#][18]
* @nateritter Just popped into my head. Were you twittering when you got the ticket ? :) [\#][19]
* @danielha @Shripriya says - check out this url - comments are 6 hrs, 5, 4, 2 and 4 hrs-?! That's what I don't get. [http://snurl.com/24jhx][20] [\#][21]
* @nateritter Ouch! In India, we have an unwritten rule. If you get one ticket (wrong side parking), you can do so all day long :) [\#][22]
* @danielha @Shripriya ohh.. so the default sort order = "Hot comments" =\> most replied comments first. My bad. How do I force one sett ... [\#][23]
