I got really sick of using Adobe AIR apps that take up more and more of system memory for an app that does twitter.

I've decided to put my "coding for myself" hat on and write a QT based C++ application (that should be cross-platform). No name as yet, but I will find something soon. QtTwitter is taken. Mebbe, once I have a working version, I can get ownership of the project on google code.

That's the proposed GUI. Sorry for the bad light. The iphone cam's not too good with tungsten light.

Any suggestions?! I will try and post some mock up as I create em. I don't want to be writing my own twitter REST c++ library. Any suggestion are welcome.
