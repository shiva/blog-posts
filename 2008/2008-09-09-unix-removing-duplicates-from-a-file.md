description: 'Unix: removing duplicates from a file'

Over the last few months, I have re-discovered some unix commands (it's been such a long time)

* _Eliminate duplicate lines from a file_

> `#sort -u filename > filename.new`

* _List all lines that do not match a condition_

> `#grep -v ajsk filename`

* _Copy contents of two files to one_

> `#cat file1 file2 > file3`

* _Append output of a command to a file_

> `#cat file1 >> file2`
