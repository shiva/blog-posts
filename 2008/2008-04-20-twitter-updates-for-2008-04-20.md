* Textbooks for Tamilnadu state board are online (I think). [http://www.textbooksonline.tn.nic.in/][0]. Seriously cool! [\#][1]
* Btw, the first chapter in 12th grade computer science is "Star office" very very kewl! [\#][2]
* and the last chapter in vol2 is "Computer Ethics". I am impressed. Kudos to the govt of Tamil Nadu for putting all of their texts online. [\#][3]
