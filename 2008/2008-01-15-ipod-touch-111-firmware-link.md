Since Apple's is so bent upon [disappointing ][0][their ][1]customers, by introducing paid firmware upgrades, I needed to ensure that I have the option to jail break, my new ipod touch (if need be). (update: the firmware upgrade itself is not paid. Only the newapps are paid). I am going to wait until they [release their SDK in February][2] before I jailbreak mine.

I found a link to the [1.1.1 firmware][3] (thanks to [Rupert][4] and who-ever posted [this][5]).  
I have a copy on my hard-drive (just in case).

Let's see how the whole thing works out. Just when I thought, Apple has a killer product, they have to limit the scope of a platform and make it a device. A very sad day for computing.
