Thanks for the iPhone, Mr. Jobs. There is a new way to protest the iPhone. I don't have to [sign petitions][1] anymore. I can now take my $500 [elsewhere][2], for a slightly more open experience. I [didn't ask for much][3], but I don't have to wait on your whim any longer (no offense meant to you personally, Mr Jobs).
