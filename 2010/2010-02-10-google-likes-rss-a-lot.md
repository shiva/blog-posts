Did anyone else notice that buzz has an RSS feed for everything!!

Here's a [conversation][0] that @[Thomashawk][1] started

Here's the [feed for that entry][2]

Here's the feed for [the owner's entries][3]

Theoretically, one could build a service that aggregates only specific conversations (and keep them updated), or only a small group etc... No more reading data from a firehose!!

That is very nice.

P.S: also this could be a way to aggregate all your webservices into one super feed, that can then be posted elsewhere (comments and all!!)

The power is endless, so be cautious when exercising it
