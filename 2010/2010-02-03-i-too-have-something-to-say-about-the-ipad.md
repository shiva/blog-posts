about the iPad, or so I thought. Then I realized with every single one of them writing pages upon pages of commentary, I'm not going to bring in too much insight. I've hence, tried to curate some interesting articles that I found. You've probably read most of them already, but in case you have been in a [di-lithium mine][0] on [Remus][1]. Yup! That's right, I do like Star Trek. Now do you understand why I loathe - hate - despise what has been done to the iPad!! [PADD][2]!! arrrrggghhh! serenity now! serenity now!

There mainly 3 kinds of responses to the iPad

1\. grumbling about the lack of features/hardware/standards

2\. Its v2.0 of the tablet that moses used

3\. It's evil. It's the end of computing as we know it

I'm not going to bother to classify the links below into the above categories ( some overlap ).

[t3rmin4t0r][14], had something interesting to say, about [censorship in Australia][15]. I think it applies quite a bit to what Apple is doing to all those who enjoy the freedom of tinkering with our computers.

> Any country attempting to close its internet borders in the name of censorship should be defeated, for the fear of setting a precedent. Censorship anywhere is a threat to freedom everywhere.

I don't believe [Apple is evil][16]. Well, at least, they are not the only company that is "evil". I do know that they are a teeny bit hypocirtical.

Oh yeah, about the iPad .. I've decided not to lease buy the iPad until

* There is a way other than Apple controlled store,
* Or, Apple open-sources its OS
* Or, Apple stops rejecting apps (any app - even the crappy kinds)

I was but 4 years old when Steve Jobs said

> It appears IBM wants it all. Apple is perceived to be the only hope to offer IBM a run for its money. Dealers initially welcoming IBM with open arms now fear an IBM-dominated and -controlled future. They are increasingly turning back to Apple as the only force that can ensure their future freedom. IBM wants it all and is aiming its guns on its last obstacle to industry control: Apple. Will _Big Blue_dominate the entire computer industry? The entire information age? Was George Orwell right?

It's been 25 years, and I fear that George Orwell might have been right after all!
