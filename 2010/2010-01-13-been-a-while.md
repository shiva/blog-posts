It's been a while since I last updated, or even had the inclination to do so ... well .. I'm back.

Here's what I've been doing since the last time I updated:

* work
* worry
* work
* procrastinate
* gain weight
* work
* quit smoking
* go to India
* fail miserably at quitting smoking
* took a lot of pictures
* return to vancouver
* work

In the end, here's what I have to show for the last month

P.S: This post is edited to remove some things I said that I shouldn't have. I eat my words :)
