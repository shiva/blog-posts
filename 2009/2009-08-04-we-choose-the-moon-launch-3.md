This is awesome. I was born a few years after the race to the moon. What a great time it would have been for all those that got to see/hear this live! In the four decades, life on earth has changed so much -- we've been de-sensitized to the miracle of flight and technology , and yet the spectacle of space travel is exhilarating as ever.
