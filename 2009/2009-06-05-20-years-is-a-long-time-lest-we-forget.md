This post is a little late, but that has never stopped me from doing it anyway. 

There are some things that we need to regret ...

And then there are some others, we continue to ignore ...

Hope we don't add more such pictures to that list in another 20 years.

Thanks to [WilW @ WWdN: In Exile][0] for inspiring me (as always)
