[![A Year in the Merde](/images/10765.jpg)][0] [A Year in the Merde][0] by [Stephen Clarke][1]

rating: 5 of 5 stars  
If you are on your way to Paris, or on the way from Paris, or in Paris, or ... nevermind... just read this book if you are associated, in any way, with Paris. You'll love it.

(If you are French, read this too, get angry, rebel and then revel in the glory! :) )
