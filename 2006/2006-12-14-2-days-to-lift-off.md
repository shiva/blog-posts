As with [Discovery][0], after a lot of hurdles (some within me and some otherwise), here I am about to take-off on yet another journey, that, I hope is going to be as exciting as the last one that I took, when I joined [HCL-Cisco ODC][1]. I has been an amazing experience in the last week or so, when I have been reminiscing about what I am about to do, what I have done, the wonderful people that I encountered and worked with, and the good and bad times.

Loads of work ahead! So I'm hoping that I will get a day to myself. I got too many people that I need to say farewell to, in person!
