Nice idea this one. So, here is my list

Chennai, TN\*  
Pondicherry, PDY^  
Bangalore, KN\*  
Delhi, DL  
Madurai, TN  
Kodaikanal, TN

^- weekend visits  
\* - multiple times (weekdays) ;)

I have another idea. A chronologically organised milestone-events list for a year. Maybe that will take some time to compose! Good for another post eh?!
