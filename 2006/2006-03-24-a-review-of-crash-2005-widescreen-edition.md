[Crash (2005) (Widescreen Edition)][0]

Some one tell me what the hell are they talking about in this movie!!!! It is the mind-numbing experience of watching 7 movies at one go.

I must give it to the director though, for tying together each of the sub-plots, but man.. you gotta tell me something by the end of the story!!
