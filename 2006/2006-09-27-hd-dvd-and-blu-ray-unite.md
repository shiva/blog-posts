[New technology could nip DVD format war in the bud][0]

That is what someone needed to do, build an abstraction layer over the various DVD/DVD-like media so that as a consumer, when I am choosing between Star Wars and Star Tre, I don't need to bother with the media type and the version etc..

Just let me but the disc and get home to watch on the blu-ray drive or at a friends place on HD-DVD drive.

Now, although it is a gross waste of disc space, it is still better that having to own multiple copies due to some corporate hangup!
