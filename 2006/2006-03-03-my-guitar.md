well, about a coupla months back, I got myself a guitar and having been since then, utting my fingers at it on and off (mostly after midnight).

I have finally learnt how to play a few bars of "Ilaya Nila", the song that really pushed me towards learning the guiatr in the first place.

After numerous attempts to find the notes myself and failing quite miserably at that, I found this amazingly true reproduction of the original, [Guitar Lesson \#8646 at WholeNote: Ilaya Nila][0] by Ananth Narayanan. Kudos to you dude!

I simply love that song. Ohh yeah, btw I just turned my fingeres sore, over that last interlude!
