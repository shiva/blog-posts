[First Images of Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo Cabin][0]

Virgin galactic is a spaceship/commercial aeronautic vehicle that is being designed to let ordinary people like you an me (well ones with $200,000 spare change) to travel to space and conduct "scientific" experiments (kiss in space? marriage in space? ahem ... in space? \*\*pervert\*\*)

and I wanna get my ass off to space in just that ... 3 days out of the earth! That will mean a lot less coding. Maybe I will come up with the first-ever "out of the world" open source software, or maybe even a yahoo widget or two!!

Now that's a thought, maybe we should have a coder's meet in orbit! I can apply for "work from orbit". You wanna sponsor my trip?!
