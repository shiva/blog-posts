[The Alchemy of Desire][0]

by Tarun J. Tejpal

This is an amazing amazing book. What prose?! and what a story?! This has rekindled my faith in Indian authors, Finally a book in â€œenglishâ€ by an Indian author, without a thousand transliterated words from Hindi.

It has made me see a few things I had forgotten, made me look and find new things, that I didnâ€(tm)t knew existed.

Thank you Tarun, you need to write more!
