I have been away far too long this time around. But, I finally find some time to do my bloggy thingy!

I managed to finally migrate to Wordpress 2.0 with the latest K2 theme. (btw great work with the theme guys)

It has been a very hectic month, and very busy and interesting start to the year! Some of the stuff I have been dabbling in since the begining of this year

- a framework for implementing a control plane in a java application (see JCtrlPlane)  
- attended the Sun Tech Days conference at Chennai on 7th, 8th and 9th of February (more on that below)  
- a kewl Java Jacket  
- lots of architectural work, at work  
- thinking about where my life is going  
- The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy  
- Catching up on old friends  
- Finally... started working out (my abs that is ;) )
