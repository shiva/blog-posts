Not that many are reading this blog, but hey, I'm back nonetheless!! Let's see if I can sustain my blogging! I've been getting ready for a change from my current job. For those who don't know, I've been working at HCL Technologies, Chennai, Cisco Offshore Development Centre, for the last 4+ years.

Reasons

1\. my wife's moving there!  
2\. My WIFE's MOVING do you need more!! ;)

I hope to start work with a company in Bangalore. So you guys in cool B'lore, here I come!

I have another coupla weeks to go, so I might be absent from the blog for the upcoming weeks! Then again, I will try to blog my experience quitting a company! That's a nice sustainable idea!
