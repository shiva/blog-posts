1\. Assuming an [average car weighs around 4000 pounds][0]

2\. Force required to move such a car (neglecting friction):

`F = ma`

As per the above,  
`  
m = 4000 /2.2 kg [approx. 1800 kg]  
a = 1 m/sec^2`

=\> F = 1800 N

3\. Since it would be next to impossible to get a rare earth magnet that produced that kind of force, we would be, better served trying to use a solenoid. The formula to get the force generated by a [solenoid is given by][1]:

F = ((N \* I) ^ 2 \* k \* A) / 2 \* g ^ 2

Where,

N - No of turns

I - Current in Amps

k = 4 \* pi \* 10 ^ -7 (constant)

A - Cross-section of the solenoid

g - distance between solenoid and the metal that needs to be attracted

From the above, assuming a cross section of 0.5 sq m (A), current of 10 A (I), and a distance of 1 m from the solenoid (g), the number of turns required to produce 1 m/sec^2 acceleration on a 1800 Kg car is,

N ~= 7.568 \* 10 ^ 3 ~= 7000 turns

Now, Density of Copper is **8.92 gm/cm3\. We can guesstimate the weight by guessing the length of such a solenoid.**
