**_[Anger is Illogical,][0]_** a film created by ["OneMinuteGalactica"][1], takes audio from one of those "behavioural" films they used to show in schools in the 1950s and 60s and video from the original _Star Trek_ TV series (run through a filter to make them look like they're on 16mm film) and combines them for hilarious results.

Here's another amusing little film from OneMinuteGalactica: **_[Luke Skywalker has OCD][2]..._**
