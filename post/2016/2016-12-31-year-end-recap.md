## Donâ€™t smoke (Stay quit!!) : Doing great!

   There is no desire to smoke. After being a smoker for over a decade, I was very glad to quit, and stay quit. The way I quit this time was quite cliched. I went to Vegas, smoked incessantly for 3 days, and stopped at the end of the trip -- cold turkey. Never went back to it, and quite frankly disgusted by the thought of smoking now.

## Say yes more often: Did well.

   I have reduced negativity greatly. This is a good one to keep at for the next year.

## Read a book a month: Failing miserably.

   Multiple incomplete books. Really finished only [one book this year][1] - The Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness rules our lives. 

   Other books caught my attention this year:

   - [Sustainable Materials - With Both Eyes Open][2] by  Julian M. Allwood, Jonathan M. Cullen
   - [Capital in the Twenty-First Century][3]  by  Thomas Piketty
   - [Domain-Specific Languages][4] by Martin Fowler

   I need to up my game here. The plan is dedicate the first weekend of every month to a book. I need to read more than one book a year!

## Write an app a month: Passable.

   Built a few apps this year. Unlike other years, I managed to finish them enough to launch them into the wild. It was quite satifying to be able to get them of a git repo, and have them running.

   I have learnt quite a bit through the process, and perhaps will write more about deploying node js apps in production.

   There is potential for a product that simplifies authentication and authorization. All [existing][5] [solutions][6] that I have tried this year still get in the way of the user. We desperately need a universal interface for identity -- perhaps hardware that can make oAuth more ammenable for login.

   - [Spellcaster][7] - find that perfect MTG card.
   - [Wishlists][8] - maintain a list of wishlists . Was especially useful for Secret Santa this year

## Blog once a week: Failing miserably.

   This is going back on the list for next year. I have consumed a lot of content this year, but produced very little.. Most of my posts have been photos on [Instagram][9] -- photos of food!
