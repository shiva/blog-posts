[The Onion : CIA Asks Bush To Discontinue Blog][0]

Come on old man! Get your grips on. You go on to tell the entire world that you have to attend a secret meeting?! Duh?! That kind of beats the purpose of a secret meeting uh?!

Well, one has to appreciate the efforts of a president, if he thinks that he wants to tell his unedited opinion about things to the people of the world. That is worth applause. It is not that I concur with all his opinions, but if we had a leader or two, who would pick up blogging and will read through the comments that the people give to his opinions, India can become a far better place?!

Don't you think so?
