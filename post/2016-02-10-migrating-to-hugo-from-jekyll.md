title: Migrating from Jekyll to Hugo
---


- why hugo?
 - much faster to re-generate compared to jekyll
 - very little dependencies 
 - opiionated => less customization


- install hugo and generated temporary site
- talk about fix-yaml.js

- fixed tool to generate required tags
- rules for fixing content
- manual vs automated
- updating and moving static content
- getting urls right
- organizing content in hugo (and getting around hugo's assumptions)

- mucking around wih temapltes


- fix-yaml - rename
- fix-yaml - support moving from yaml to toml and json
