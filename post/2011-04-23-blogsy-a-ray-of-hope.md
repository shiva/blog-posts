description: Blogsy - a ray of hope

This is a test post from [blogsy][0], an iPad blogging tool.

The interface design looks thoughtful -- drag & drop of images from flickr and picasa, videos from YouTube, a built it google search and browser to get at other content. Although there is a bit of a learning curve, it makes the iPad a true content generation device.

Maybe this will keep me blogging this time around. On that note, here's a cutie pie to bring a smile to you, today.
