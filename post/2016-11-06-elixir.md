## Types

### Atoms

Named contants with a value. `true` and `false` are atoms.

### Strings

- Supports unicode string natively! It's about time. 
- You can concatenate strings using `<>`. `"hello" <> " world"`.
- *CAUTION*: `byte_size("hellö") != String.length("hellö")`.
- *CAUTION*: (char list) `'hello' != "hello"` (string)


### Anonymous functions

Native support for closures -- called anonymous functions. Also, functions are first-class aka can be passed as arguments into other functions. Special syntax is required to invoke ananymous functions.

```
iex(1)> add = fn a,b -> a + b end
#Function<12.52032458/2 in :erl_eval.expr/5>
iex(2)> add.(1,2)
3
iex(3)> mulby2 = fn a -> add.(a,a) end
#Function<6.52032458/1 in :erl_eval.expr/5>
iex(4)> mulby2.(4)
8
iex(5)> 
```

### Lists

Native support for lists. hd(list) and tl(list). A list of printable characters will be output as a string. Slower linear access to data, but really fast to prepend elements to the list. eg. `[ 0 | list]`. 



### Tuples

Native support for associative arrays. Any pair of values, stored contiguously. Indexes start from zero. mutable `put_elem(tuple, idx, "value")`. Fast access, but expensive to add or insert elements

### Other types

Port, Reference and PID


## Operations

Note that ===, and !== use type when comparing (thankfully, the defaults are sensible)

  - +, - , ++, --, <> (concatenate)
  - and, or, not
  - &&, ||, !
  - ==, !=, === (more strict), !== (more strict), <=, >=, < and > 
  - nil/false == false (everything else is true)

 ## The match operator
