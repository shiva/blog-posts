Weird/new things in Elixir

Types:
 - atom
    named contants with a value. `true` and `false` are atoms. i.e `((true == :true) == true)`. 
 - string
    Supports unicode string natively! It's about time. CAUTION: byte size of a string != length.
 - Anonymous functions
    Native support for closures -- called anonymous functions. Also, functions are first-class aka can be passed as arguments into other functions. Special syntax is required to invoke ananymous functions.
```
iex(1)> add = fn a,b -> a + b end
#Function<12.52032458/2 in :erl_eval.expr/5>
iex(2)> add.(1,2)
3
iex(3)> mulby2 = fn a -> add.(a,a) end
#Function<6.52032458/1 in :erl_eval.expr/5>
iex(4)> mulby2.(4)
8
iex(5)> 
```
