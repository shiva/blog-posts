I booked a swift this weekend. Seems like it will take almost 5 months for delivery! I hate this BS dished by Maruti to its customers. Why introduce a car, which is by far the most economical in its class, packed with features and expect it to sell only 5000 a month?! Well, the sales rep at a Maruti Dealer told me the production capacity was just 5000 a month, and they already have booking close to 30000?!

I can't fathom how such a blunder can be made by a company that is considered to be at the forefront of the Indian auto industry. It is quite irritating, having to wait for 5 months, but I'm sure the end product is work the wait! Itching to get my hands on those wheels!
