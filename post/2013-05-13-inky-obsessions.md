Have I mentioned the long-standing obsession with stationery, especially, fountain pens? Well, it is a bit of problem, really. In the last few months, I have started hoarding them. It started with one-- a Lamy. Once I discovered how one can procure junk on eBay for very little money, I quickly ended up with a selection. As these things go, I suddenly had the increased "need" for inks that are not blue, or black. Nay, simple colours won't do for the truly obsessed.

Here is the result of the latest rotation of inks and pens.
