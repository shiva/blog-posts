I'm a bit of a stickler, when it comes to audio recording. I hate using the mics that come with laptops or the standard desktop mic. Recently, a co-worker asked me about my setup (I record a piano, strictly for my listening pleasure, and NO, MIDI doesn't count).

I couldn't find the links for my version of the mic, but here are some equivalents.

**USB Mics**

[MXL .006 USB Mic][0]  
[MXL .007 USB Mic][1]

**Mixers**

[Berhinger 502][2]  
[Berhinger 802][3]  
[Berhinger 1202][4]

Once you start using a condenser mic, and hear the richness of the output, you'll never want to go back to the crappy on-board mics.
