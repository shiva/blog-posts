### Searching for symbols

The product that I work on, has over 22 million lines of source -- most of it a nightmare. I use vim as my editor of choice [^1]. Both cscope and ctags (integrated into vim), allow me to quickly move between files and lookup definitions of symbols, and help in understanding the challenge-du-jour. 

Throw in fuzzy find capabilities of the most awesome [Ctrl+p plugin][1], and vim becomes the best 'IDE' out there!

However, large code bases result in very large indexes. A fully indexed ctags file for the product I work is several gigabytes. At this scale, searching for a symbols slows vim down substantially. It is vital to isolate and index a portion of the source -- the part that I am interested in on a given day.

I use the following aliases to build tags files and cscope databases as I need.

### Dealing with whitespace

I like to strip trailing whitespace. Trailing whitespace, results in confusing diffs between two versions of a file. It increases the congnitive dissonance when reading git-diffs and patches -- it is quite tiresome when reviewing 20-30 commits a day. 

The following aliases help strip trailing whitespace given a file and keep commits deltas devoid of un-necessary whitespace changes.

[^1]: Don't even think of using eclipse or another IDE. A code-base this size, is simply too large for anything except simple text-based tools
