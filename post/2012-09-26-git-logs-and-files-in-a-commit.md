Working with git is fun. However, it is easy to get tired of the log list of parameters one has to use to very often. Git aliases are a great way to deal with this.

{{< gist shiva 3791502 file-git-config-alias >}}

For instance, the standard git log, it pretty much useless in any large project, where there are several hundred commits in a day. Most often, the commit you are looking for in probably several pages deep.

The following is from the latest [linux.git][0]  

{{< gist shiva 3791502 file-git-log-output-for-linux >}}

Fortunately, git log has options one can use, that make the output look like this:  

{{< gist shiva 3791502 file-git-lg-output-for-linux >}}

Another useful command is git show, with the --name-only option. It displays the list of files in a particular commit.  

{{< gist shiva 3791502 file-git-show-name-only >}}
