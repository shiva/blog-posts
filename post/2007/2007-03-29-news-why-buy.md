He talks about how "selling news is dead". I thinks he hits the nail on the head with this one. When was the last time, that you read/saw, a news items that was worth buying the newspaper for?

I can hardly remember the time, I needed to pick a newspaper, let alone buy one. Well, I do read a couple of articles once a week, on the papers that lie around in my office reception.
