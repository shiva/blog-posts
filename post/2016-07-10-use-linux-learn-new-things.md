After 12+ years, I built a [workstation from scratch][0]. Hardware has come such a long way, but that is a post unto itself. Having always worked with Ubuntu and other debian variants it was time to venture into a more lean distro. I picked [Arch Linux][4], on the recommendation of several colleagues. It's been fun. [Pacman][1] and [Yaourt][2] are great package managers, and the [rolling release][3] model ensures access to the bleeding edge all the time.

Working in linux always makes you learn something new. Today, I found out a simple way to shutdown KDE gracefully.

``` bash
# qdbus org.kde.ksmserver /KSMServer logout 0 0 0
```
