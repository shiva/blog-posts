This is amazing.. Imagine being able to have a device implanted in your body, with which you cantrol with your thought, and which will use your brain as a hardrive, and use blood sugar as a battery cell.

Eerie thought envelop me, when I think of what could be?!! Living the matrix ?!!  
It is not only the body heat that can be a source of energy (like in "The Matrix"), even human blood sugar can be harnesed!

This better be a hoax, or I will have to shave my head for that pod implant and create space on the back of my skul for a USB port! Scary to think, that the next upgrade will have to be my brain (for lack of storage space!!)
