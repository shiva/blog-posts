Congrats to Thomashawk on the [flickr interview][0]!

"Why? Who?", you ask. [Thomashawk][1], photographer extraordinaire, has taught me a lot about photography. I've never met him, or gone on a photo-walk (to be fixed some day), but have learnt from his work, nonetheless.

I am compelled to write this, because, in some ways, there is a certain vindication to Flickr doing an article on him. He has been Flickr's ardent fan, and critic. It's been a long road! From the fun insanity of DMU(s), Zooomr, and flickr censorship to getting some well reserved recognition. Kudos!
