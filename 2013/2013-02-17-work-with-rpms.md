Unix. I love thee!

Extract an rpm without installing in to the current directory (really, the rpm command should support this):

`  
$ rpm2cpio myrpmfile.rpm | cpio -idmv`

\*i: Restore archive

\*d: Create leading directories where needed

\*m: Retain previous file modification times when creating files

\*v: Verbose i.e. display progress  

List contents of an rpm:

`  
$ rpm -qlp myrpmfile.rpm  
`
