I wonder what's happening to me. This is the third post in the last one hour. I must be going crazy. Anyway, this must the least used blog on earth, so what the heck. (I know there are a few of you out there, but you don't say much on my blog!! :( )

Before I bore you into leaving this page, here's what this post is about:

**Have you seen this somewhere?**

[![](/images/wear01_autumn0702.jpg)][0] 

(Ohh.. for those who can't place that photo, isn't that a wallpaper that comes with Windows XP?!)

Nick Toshces, asked himself that, and didn't stop at that. He went about asking half the world. He bullied Microsoft, Bill Gates, a few of his friends and the photographer himself. So where is this place? Find out [here][1].

This is one problem that you wouldn't face with Windows Vista. Check out [this][2] and [this][3].

Jason Kottke, put me onto this. Thanks to you, Jason, for a wonderful feed. You are my [link][4] to the world (pun intented).

Btw, if you find it difficult (lazy/bored), to load up my website, please use a feedreader. There are several out [there][5]. I use [Google reader][6], which is probably google's best app till date, apart from search and gmail. You can read it from anywhere, including my new [Nokia N73][7], which I think is a pretty amazing feature. (I can't share from my mobile - such a drab)
