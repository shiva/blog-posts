Having broken my elbow, I have spent the last two weeks typing away with a single hand. With nothing much to do, I went about looking at ways to improve the capabilities of blog editors. I use BlogDesk for my blogging needs. It is a wonderful editor, that let you do all operations provided by MetaWeblog API. However I wanted to do more than what was provided there. I wanted to add some features for plugins that I used.

The following is a propopsed list of extensions:

* Create/edit posts  
- define post passwords (_Thanks to [Johannes Oppermann][0], developer of the wonderful blog client, BlogDesk_[)][0]  
- image insert from different services (flickr)  
- tagging support  
- Similar to [QuickTags][1] plugin  
- Support for [Ultimate Tag Warrior's ][2] features  
- Adsense integration
* 
Admin Support  
- display a dasboard  
- Spam Karma comment moderation  
- Adsense data

In my search I found some interesting links.

Well, the end result, here's the pre-Alpha version of [WPexAPI][8].
