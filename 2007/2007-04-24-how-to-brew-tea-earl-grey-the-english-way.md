I've been on a reading binge lately. With quite a few hours of flying time, and long waits at airport lounges, I got the chance to catch up on my reading. Went through two books this time around, the placid, but mildly interesting ["The Namesake" by Jhumpa Lahiri][0] (skip the book and [watch the movie][1].. way better) and the exhilariting final masterpiece, ["The Salmon of Doubt",][2] ([wikipedia entry here][3]) by the new age, space comic, [Douglas][4] [Adams][5].

The Salmon, is a collection of various bits of Douglas' writing, and it reveals the quirky, and funny guy that he was. I couldn't resist putting this anecdote online (although it might be breaching some copyright - so please don't copy it any further and if someone wants to take this down, just drop me a comment)

**How to brew Tea - Douglas Adams**

1. Go to Marks and Spencer and by a packet of Earl Grey tea.
2. Go back to where you are staying and boil a kettle of water.
3. While it is coming to boil, open the sealed packet and sniff.
4. Careful - you may feel a bit dizzy, but this is in fact perfectly legal.
5. When the kettle has boiled, pour a little of it into a teapot, swirl it around , and tip it out again.
6. Put a couple (or three, depending on the size of the pot) of tea bags into the pot. (If I was really trying to lead you into the paths of righteousness, I would tell you to use free leaves rather than bags, but let's take this in easy stages.)
7. Bring the kettle back upto a boil, and then pour the boiling water as quickly as you can into the pot.
8. Let it stand for two or three minutes, and then pour it into a cup.

He continues, "Some will tell you that you shouldn't have milk with Earl Grey, just a slice of lemon. Screw them. I like it with milk."

now, there it is. That's how you make a wonderful pot of tea for yourself. Earl Grey at that - the English Way. And, what do you know, he likes it with milk, just like I do! Now, go make yourself a pot of tea and sip at it!!
