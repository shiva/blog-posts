[Nishabd][0] is a re-make of the very famous russian movie, Lolitta. I know, that the flavour of the day is re-mixing movies, but I must confess.. what a re-make? Amazing movie! I was simply blown away by the pathos of the story, the power of Amitabh's eyes and the great performances of every single character.

Personally, I think, this is the best performance by Amitabh. yes.. even more than Black. He has truly scaled peaks that probably most actors in the world can ever see. Finally, a movie that has created some hope for bollywood and the Indian film industry. We have class, we are the masters of pathos. We can do with more Nishabd's. Mr. RGV, are you listening?
