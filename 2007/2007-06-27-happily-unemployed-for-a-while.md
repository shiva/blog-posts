I recently quit my job at Novell. After more than half a decade of working 5 days a week and several hours a day, I get to spend my time doing only things I want to do. No more tasks that I have to complete, no more deadlines, no more betas to release (atleast for a few more weeks). I get some time to myself before take a deep dive into the job of chucking out code day-in and day-out.

Here are some thing that I thoroughly enjoyed doing in the first week :

1. Started learning RoR.
2. Check my email and respond!
3. Read all my feeds the first thing in the morning. 
4. Install all required software on my laptop.
5. [Uploaded some pictures][0] on [zooomr][1]. (yeah they are up and stable now)

I have started work on a small project in rails, which I shall announce once I have a working prototype.
