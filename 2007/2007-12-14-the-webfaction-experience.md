The reason for the respite in my blogging, was my move to a new web-host. After several hours of researching, I decided to go with [webfaction.com][0]. If you haven't already visited webfaction, [DO IT right now][0]! It has been simply amazing. I love the one click installer, and within hours of getting billed, I got access to my account. It comes with shell access, SFTP, enough space, [rails 2.x][1] (just days after it was release), [django][2], [wordpress 2.3.1][3] and a host of other webapps, all of which you can install with a just a few clicks on their web interface.
