Been using Windows Live Writer as my blog writing tool. Here are some plugins that I would definetly make my life much easier. If you are insterested in writing a plugin or would like to add to these requirements, do get in touch.

1. **Extended Link insertion**
  * Link to different Search Engines (Google, Google Blog Search, Code search, Sun API search, Technocrati search etc.) 
  * Link to various product sites (Amazon, RitzCamera etc) 
  * Link to previously exisitng Posts 
  * Recent Links 
  * Links from clipboard 
  * Auto-link insertion based on certain keywords 
  * Multiple link inclusion - when this mode is enabled every word that is clicked on / selected should be added to a bucket, which can then be used to create links on.
2. **Note-taking**
  * Separate interface for storing notes/ideas for blog entries 
  * Allow search across notes 
  * Auto-complete using phrases from existing notes (optional) 
  * Plugin for Firefox and IE to enable addition of notes by selecting text on browsers
3. **Monetize** \#
  * Support for various ad tools like adsense, amazon associate etc.
4. **Wordpress Style Support\#** 
5. **Review Publishing\#\***
  * Wordpress plugin that allows to create a set of reviews for various products 
  * Allow access of reviews separate from posts. (can use a set of categories for this - similar to asides plugin) 
  * Allow posting to this through categories, or allow through a plugin in windows live writer as "write review' 
6. **Drafts sync\#**
  * Allow multiple instances of windows live writer to share drafts. 
  * upload selected drafts to wordpress 
  * check-box for using wordpress drafts instead of local drafts 
  * button for pulling drafts from wordpress and adding them to local drafts

\# - might require extending existing XML-RPC (should be possible with wordpress)  
\* - might require wordpress plugin
