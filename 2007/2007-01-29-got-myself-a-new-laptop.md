I'm now officially one of the self-obssessed techie guys, sitting in public places and completely ignoring all the life-forms around me. Got a very nice deal from HP. Here is the config!

[**HP Pavillion DV2124TU**][0]  
Intel Pentium Core Duo 1.6 Ghz  
1 GB (2 X 512 MB) DDR2 SDRAM  
Intel 945 800Mhz FSB Motheboard  
14.1" Widescreen Display  
LightScribe DVD-RW drive  
802.11 a/b/g wireless  
Bluetooth  
Infrared  
Altec Lansing Speakers  
Built in modem and ethernet ports  
3 USB ports  
1 DV based USB  
SD/MMC-Pro/MS/XD card reader  
Remote control for DVD player  
Windows XP Media Center Edition

It costs around Rs. 56000 in India. Since I bought the laptop before the 31 jan 2007, I get the following freebies

Hauppage USB TV tuner card  
Reliance USB Internet Data card

This is essentially the dv2000 branded as 2124 in India. oh yeah, since I bought it betwwen Nov 06 and Mar 07, I get a free upgrade to Windows Vista when it is released.

It took me the whole of the weekend to get it into working shape, installing all the necessary open source tools that I use. Still a lot of work ahead. I hope to blog more since I have access to decent computing power where ever I go.
