Philipp Lenssen, has an interesting (scary) thought about the day that [google acquired the world (aka internet :) ).][0] The date that he has chosen, 12 May 2017, sent a shiver up my spine. I, definitely, don't want to see the world taken over by the most efficient search engine on my birthday!! :) That would be some scary stuff to wake up too.

Since we are on the subject of acquisitions, [google paid over $3 billion for doubleclick][1], a company that [google didn't beleive in][2] when it wanted to serve ads in the first place. How ironic! You pay more than what you invested in your company, to acquire something you didn't believe in! I find that a little absurd, and you?
