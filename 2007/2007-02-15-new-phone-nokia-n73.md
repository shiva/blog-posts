I dropped my trusty ol' Nokia 6610, from the third floor, at my office. After scourring the gazillion models and options that are available out there, I settled on two phones.

Sony Ericsson K790 Cybershot

Nokia N73

guess what, although the other phones seem to catch up on paper, in reality nokia still wins hands-down. Just hold the two phones in your hand, and you know that the Nokia oozes quality. There are a few gripes though, which I will reserve for later.

Without anymore blabbering, here are some images that I took, without tweaking anything. Be warned that I have left exposure, white balance, flash and iso, all at auto mode.
