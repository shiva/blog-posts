It has just dawned on me that I have more work to do, that when I was employed. So many things to catch up on: emails, [orkut][0] messages, [linked-in][1] invites (ohh. [Kristopher Tate][2] is a contact now! Thanks Kris! :) ). 

Talking of linked-in, the pressure from the ['opening-up'][3] of [facebook][4] is showing. Linked-in has added several new features and made interaction much easier than it was before. Things are where they should be; A free member can get in touch with someone they know directly. No need for any introductions if you know a person. (you don't need to know their mail id, either). Finally someone at Linked-in realized that they need to accelerate the rate at with the interconnections were formed between people. That's where the money is.

I kinda like the Linked-in system. It is one of the most unobtrusive social-networking sites. It doesn't send me a mail for every single action someone does (by default) and also let's me turn stuff off! I like that in a site.
