[Zooomr][0], for those of you, who don't know it, is a photo-sharing site, that is developed and maintained by a single developer, [Kristopher][1] [Tate][2]. Thomas Hawk, the CEO, is a wonderful photographer, and writes a great blog, which you should check out.

If Flickr started web2.0 photo-sharing, zooomr is slowly moving the game forward. The latest version of zooomr, offers a bunch of new features, that are nothing short of amazing. Now, they are offering [free pro-accounts for bloggers ][3]who use zooomr. (Marketing tip \#1: Befriend the blogger). Ohh, btw, you can choose to use zooomr, on any blog service that allows you to add html to your post. I guess, that includes every single blog service out there!
