description: Wordpress commended for lack of spam
---

Me and thousands of other people, continue to use wordpress, one of the leading blog management systems (sounds kewl, eh? ;) ), and proof that is it in fact leading is [here][0].

Apparently, [Wordpress.com][1], has the least spam, compared to other free blog-hosting services. The honored list of competitors, include the likes of google, myspace and AOL, each one of them goliaths! [Matt Mullenweg][2], the creator of [Wordpress][3], associates the success of wordpress.com spam protection to Akismet. This is something that I use now. I used spam-karma before this, which was pretty good, but with Akismet, it is almost zero-management.

Google, with its wonderful, spam filter on gmail, should be able to do much better, but then, comment spam is a very different ball game.
