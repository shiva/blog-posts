_[Bug \#1 in Ubuntu - Microsoft has a majority market share][0]_

I tried to see how the latest release of Ubuntu has addressed this particular bug, and I see that it is still pending. Although, the open-source OS guys are striving a lot for features, but somehow everyone has forgotten the root-cause that made unix so popular. 

Both System V and BSD version allowed the user to quick execute a set of jobs, allowed users to stitch small applications to make bigger equivalents of them. I see that no one is trying to challenge the notion of UI that Windows introduced back in the last century! A lot of that is happening on the web, but we need that kind of radical rethinking of UI, if you want to kick Microsoft's share down!
