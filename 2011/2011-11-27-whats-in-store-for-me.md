I just watched the last 30 mins of the movie "The green mile". What a beautiful movie! The last few lines was particularly well written. "we each owe a death; there are no exceptions; but, Oh God, sometimes the Green Mile seems so long. But if he can make a mouse live so long, I wonder what is in store for me"

Don't we all! 

The sun is out in Vancouver ! Time to get out!
