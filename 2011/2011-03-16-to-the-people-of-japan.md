To the people of Japan, and the world, Lord Tennyson has these words

> Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho'
> 
> We are not now that strength which in old days
> 
> Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are,--
> 
> One equal temper of heroic hearts,
> 
> Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
> 
> To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.
