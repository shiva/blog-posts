Last weekend, I went to my first photo-walk in Vancouver. This one is a yearly affair, organized by Scott Kelby. It's called the [Worldwide Photowalk][0] ([\#WWPW][1]), and it was quite exciting. This was the fourth such event (and my first). I met a lot of very interesting people of varied backgrounds. Can't wait for the next one.

Flickr groups for the photo-walk are:  
[Gastown][2]  
[Scott Kelby's WWPW4][3]

Thanks to Scott Kelby for starting such a wonderful thing, and letting it grow. This was as exciting as [last year's Barcamp][4]
