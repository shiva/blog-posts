DMU (Delete me Uncensored) is a [group on Flickr][0], that was formed because a few people got pissed at Flickr censoring content. It is a very "lively" place on most days with a [lot ][1]of [colour ][2]and [personality][3]. Mostly its just a bunch of fine folks that have a common passion (photography), and express their opinions with almost no filters. It's easy to mistake the group for being too rude, but you just have to hang around to 'get it'.

I've had a [on-again off-again DMU addiction][4] mainly because it feels more authentic to me, mostly because I've seen how serious they are about the art form, but also take themselves lightly. I chanced upon two very interesting music videos on one of the threads.

[Living Colour - Cult Of Personality][5].

[Lakeside - Your Wish Is My Command][6]
