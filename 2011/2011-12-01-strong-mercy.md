When in doubt, take a poet's thought to your heart. They are, invariably experienced beings, that have spent a great deal of their lives, exploring the heart through the mind.

> **Strong Mercy by Rabindranath Tagore**
> 
> My desires are many and my cry is pitiful,  
> but ever didst thou save me by hard refusals;  
> and this strong mercy has been wrought into my life through and through. 
> 
> Day by day thou art making me worthy of the simple,  
> great gifts that thou gavest to me unasked---this sky and the light, this body and the  
> life and the mind---saving me from perils of overmuch desire.
> 
> There are times when I languidly linger  
> and times when I awaken and hurry in search of my goal;  
> but cruelly thou hidest thyself from before me. 
> 
> Day by day thou art making me worthy of thy full acceptance by  
> refusing me ever and anon, saving me from perils of weak, uncertain desire.

This poem, expresses a lot of what's on my mind, at this ungodly hour (its 3:39 am), except for the last couple of lines. I didn't want to editorialize a poem, and hence left it in place.
