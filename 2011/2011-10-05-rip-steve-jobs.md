[DeWitt Clinton][0] once [wrote][1]

> What are the hallmarks of a great engineer? A great engineer is characterized by their intelligence, versatility, creativity, loyalty, passion, experience, vision, dedication, composure, humility, and ability.

Apart from the "humility" part, which he never cared for, Steve Jobs was the epitome of that description. We shall miss you Mr. Jobs, especially for that keen sense of doing something perfectly.

[RIP Steve Jobs][2], the maker of beautiful things.
