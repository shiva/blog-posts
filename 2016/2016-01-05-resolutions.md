The word "resolutions", feels forced. It feels like a ritual declaration of intent, followed immediately by inaction, and eventually concession that it was all in jest. This year, I am going to have some goals. 

 - Donâ€™t smoke
 - Say yes more often
 - Read a book a month
 - Write an app a month
 - Blog once a week

Goals, feels more friendly, reachable, inviting almost.
