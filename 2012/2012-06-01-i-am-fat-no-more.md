BMI, is not the best measure of health, or fitness, but \>30 is a definite indicator of lack of care about one's health. After several years of exactly that, I'm finally within reasonable limits. My BMI is 24.0; It's official, I'm [not obese anymore][0].

In the last 4 years, I have seen my weight go from 230 lbs to 266 lbs, and back to 202 lbs, as of today.

It's a good day!
