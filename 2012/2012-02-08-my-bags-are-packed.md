This saturday, I will be leaving to Sweden for work. It will be an exciting two months! Hopefully, I will have some time to enjoy and experience a new country, and chronicle the (mis)adventures there!

For now, here's some music. This song has followed me around for the last 12 years, and when it is time for me to go away, I hear this song playing somwhere. It's corny, but its nice.
